# C-LAMP
Smart infrared controlled LED lamp with Audio Reactive and E1.31 support
This project is heavily adapted from Scott Marley's ESP32 FFT VU project
https://github.com/s-marley/ESP32_FFT_VU

The final build has taken quite some time, but documentation for this still on early stage. 
I will try to gradually add details on documentation.

Schematics is as follows. Details on ESP32 pin assignment can be obtained in codes, pin order might differs on different type of ESP32, please refer to particular esp32 manufacturer.
